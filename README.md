You're absolutely right! Let's revise the `README.md` file to include a **detailed explanation of the model** and remove references to plots since your project does not currently include them. I'll also ensure that the model explanation is comprehensive and easy to understand.

# **Energy Network Optimization Model**

This repository contains an optimization model for managing energy networks. The model integrates fossil fuel generation, renewable energy sources, and battery storage to meet electricity demand while minimizing costs and adhering to operational constraints.

## **Overview**
The goal of this project is to optimize the operation of an energy network by balancing supply and demand while considering:
- Fossil fuel generation (with costs, ramp rates, and emission limits).
- Renewable energy integration (e.g., solar or wind availability).
- Battery storage dynamics (charging, discharging, and capacity limits).
- Spinning reserve requirements for reliability.
- Emission caps to reduce environmental impact.

This model uses **Julia** with the **JuMP** package for optimization and the **HiGHS** solver for solving linear programming problems.

---

## **Model Explanation**
### **Objective**
The primary objective of the model is to **minimize total operational costs** while satisfying all operational and physical constraints. The total cost includes:
1. **Fossil Fuel Generation Costs**:
   - Each fossil unit has a per-unit generation cost (`fossil_gen_cost`) and a fixed start-up cost (`fossil_start_cost`).
2. **Battery Operation Costs**:
   - A fixed cost is associated with charging and discharging the battery (`battery_cost`).

### **Decision Variables**
The model uses the following decision variables:
1. **Fossil Generation**:
   - `gen[f,t]`: Power generated by fossil unit `f` at time `t`.
2. **Unit Commitment**:
   - `on[f,t]`: Binary variable indicating whether fossil unit `f` is ON at time `t`.
   - `start_up[f,t]`: Binary variable indicating whether fossil unit `f` starts up at time `t`.
   - `shut_down[f,t]`: Binary variable indicating whether fossil unit `f` shuts down at time `t`.
3. **Renewable Energy**:
   - `ren[t]`: Renewable energy used at time `t`.
   - `curtail[t]`: Renewable energy curtailed (not used) at time `t`.
4. **Battery Operations**:
   - `charge[t]`: Power charged into the battery at time `t`.
   - `discharge[t]`: Power discharged from the battery at time `t`.
   - `stored[t]`: Energy stored in the battery at time `t`.

### **Constraints**
The model enforces the following constraints:
1. **Demand Balance**:
   - At each time step, the total power supplied (fossil generation + renewables + battery discharge) must equal the demand:
     $$
     \text{sum(gen[f,t])} + \text{ren[t]} + \text{discharge[t]} - \text{charge[t]} = \text{demand[t]}
     $$

2. **Renewable Availability**:
   - Renewable energy used cannot exceed the available renewable energy:
     $$
     \text{ren[t]} + \text{curtail[t]} = \text{renewable_avail[t]}
     $$

3. **Battery Dynamics**:
   - The battery's stored energy evolves over time based on charging and discharging:
     $$
     \text{stored[t]} = \text{stored[t-1]} + \text{battery_efficiency} \cdot \text{charge[t-1]} - \frac{\text{discharge[t-1]}}{\text{battery_efficiency}}
     $$
   - Initial condition: $\text{stored[1]} = 0$.

4. **Prevent Over-Discharge**:
   - Discharge cannot exceed the stored energy:
     $$
     \text{discharge[t]} \leq \text{stored[t-1]}
     $$

5. **Start-Up and Shut-Down Tracking**:
   - Start-up and shut-down indicators track changes in unit commitment:
     $$
     \text{start_up[f,t]} \geq \text{on[f,t]} - \text{on[f,t-1]}
     $$
     $$
     \text{shut_down[f,t]} \geq \text{on[f,t-1]} - \text{on[f,t]}
     $$

6. **Minimum Up/Down Times**:
   - Units must stay ON or OFF for a minimum number of hours:
     $$
     \text{sum(on[f,τ] for τ in t:(t + min_up_time[f] - 1))} \leq \text{min_up_time[f]} \cdot \text{on[f,t]}
     $$
     $$
     \text{sum(1 - on[f,τ] for τ in t:(t + min_down_time[f] - 1))} \leq \text{min_down_time[f]} \cdot (1 - \text{on[f,t]})
     $$

7. **Ramp Rates**:
   - Fossil units cannot increase or decrease generation too quickly:
     $$
     |\text{gen[f,t]} - \text{gen[f,t-1]}| \leq \text{ramp_limit[f]}
     $$

8. **Spinning Reserve**:
   - Sufficient backup capacity must be available to handle unexpected changes:
     $$
     \text{sum(on[f,t] \cdot \text{fossil_capacity[f]} - \text{gen[f,t]} for f in fossil_units)} + (\text{charge_discharge_limit} - \text{discharge[t]}) \geq \text{reserve_fraction} \cdot \text{demand[t]}
     $$

9. **Emission Cap**:
   - Total emissions from fossil generation must not exceed a specified limit:
     $$
     \text{sum(emission_factor[f] \cdot \text{gen[f,t]} for f in fossil_units, t in time_periods)} \leq \text{emission_cap}
     $$

10. **Link Generation to Unit Commitment**:
    - Fossil units can only generate power if they are ON:
      $$
      \text{gen[f,t]} \leq \text{on[f,t]} \cdot \text{fossil_capacity[f]}
      $$
