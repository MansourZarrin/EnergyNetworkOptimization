# **Energy Network Optimization**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model designed to optimize energy network operations. The goal is to minimize the total cost of energy generation and storage while satisfying energy demand over a 24-hour period. The model incorporates fossil fuel plants, renewable energy sources, and battery storage systems, considering costs, capacities, and operational constraints.

## **Problem Description**

The model optimizes the operation of:
1. **Fossil Fuel Power Plants**: Traditional energy sources with high operational costs but reliable output.
2. **Renewable Energy Sources**: Variable and cost-free energy sources like wind and solar, constrained by availability.
3. **Battery Storage Systems**: Used to store excess energy for later use, with efficiency and capacity constraints.

### **Objective**
Minimize the total cost of energy generation and storage over a 24-hour period.

### **Decision Variables**
1. **Generation**:
   - $g_{i,t}$ : Energy generated by source $i$  (fossil or renewable) at time $t$  (MW).
2. **Battery Operations**:
   - $c_t$ : Battery charging rate at time $t$  (MW).
   - $d_t$ : Battery discharging rate at time $t$  (MW).
   - $s_t$ : Energy stored in the battery at time $t$  (MWh).

## **Mathematical Model**

### **Sets**
- $t \in T$ : Time periods (e.g., 24 hours).
- $i \in I$ : Energy sources (1: Fossil, 2: Renewable).

### **Parameters**
1. **Cost Parameters**:
   - $c_{gen,i}$ : Cost of energy generation for source $i$  ($/MWh).
   - $c_{store}$ : Cost of charging/discharging the battery ($/MWh).
2. **Capacity Parameters**:
   - $cap_i$ : Maximum capacity of source $i$  (MW).
   - $cap_{battery}$ : Maximum storage capacity of the battery (MWh).
   - $cap_{charge}$ : Maximum charge/discharge rate of the battery (MW).
3. **Efficiency**:
   - $\eta$ : Efficiency of battery storage (e.g., 90%).
4. **Demand and Availability**:
   - $d_t$ : Energy demand at time $t$  (MW).
   - $a_t$ : Renewable energy availability at time $t$  (MW).

### **Objective Function**
Minimize the total cost of generation and storage:
$$\text{Minimize:} \quad \sum_{t \in T} \left( \sum_{i \in I} c_{gen,i} \cdot g_{i,t} + c_{store} \cdot (c_t + d_t) \right)$$

### **Constraints**
1. **Demand Satisfaction**:
$$\sum_{i \in I} g_{i,t} + d_t - c_t = d_t \quad \forall t \in T$$

2. **Generation Limits**:

$$g_{i,t} \leq \begin{cases}
cap_i, & \text{if } i = 1 \ (\text{Fossil}) \\
a_t, & \text{if } i = 2 \ (\text{Renewable})
\end{cases} \quad \forall i \in I, t \in T$$

3. **Battery Storage Dynamics**:
$$s_t = s_{t-1} + \eta \cdot c_{t-1} - \frac{d_{t-1}}{\eta} \quad \forall t \in T, t > 1$$
$$s_1 = 0 \quad (\text{Initial battery state})$$

4. **Battery Capacity and Charge/Discharge Limits**:
$$0 \leq s_t \leq cap_{battery} \quad \forall t \in T$$
$$0 \leq c_t, d_t \leq cap_{charge} \quad \forall t \in T$$
